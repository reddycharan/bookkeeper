# Sfstore Version Scheme:
# - Increment the major version whenever we sync from Apache bookkeeper community branch
#   and there is a new version of Bookkeeper released at that time. E.g. Bookkeeper version
#   bumped from 4.5.0 to 4.6.0, the next time we sync, we increment SFSTORE_MAJOR_VERSION
#   by 1.
# - The minor version will be bumped with every new internal release; it will bumped
#   by the Jenkins job that creates the new golden image.
# - The patch version will be bumped by the Jenkins job that is creating a new patch
#   release.
# - The APACHE_BOOKKEEPER_VERSION should be kept in sync with the version number in
#   Apache bookkeeper branch.
#
# The Jenkins job reads the values in this file and stamps the version number on all
# all the artifacts like the jar files, etc. It also renames the deploy package accordingly.
# Please don't change the formatting of the following because sftools/bk_scripts/sfstore_version.sh
# script relies on this formatting. If you do need to change, please update that script as well.
#
SFSTORE_MAJOR_VERSION=1
SFSTORE_MINOR_VERSION=4
SFSTORE_PATCH_VERSION=0
APACHE_BOOKKEEPER_VERSION=4.5.0
